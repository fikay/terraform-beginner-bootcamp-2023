                The Frontier War is over. After decades of conflict between the IMC and the militia founded to fight them, the region of space known as the Frontier can finally see peace.<br>
                <br>
                But liberation can come at a cost: the Frontier worlds were left barren by the war, and promised aid dwindled to nothing. With no way to support themselves, those who remained had no choice but to leave their homes. The brave relocated to the Outlands.<br>
                <br>
                A remote cluster of planets on the fringes of the Frontier, the Outlands are untouched by war and teeming with resources and opportunity. But life is cheap here, and danger lurks around every corner. 
                Its pioneers, explorers, and outlaws used to spend their lives locked in an endless power struggle – now, they settle their differences in the Apex Games, a bloodsport where Legends from all corners of the Frontier compete for money, fame, and glory.

                                    Years ago, she woke up in an IMC detention facility with no memory of who she was. Senior Science Pilot Renee Blasey, who volunteered as guinea pig for her own experiments... whose partner betrayed her and locked her away… no longer existed. 
                                    All that was left was a timid girl, frightened by a cacophony of voices in her head, until another version of herself appeared and taught her to listen to the voices. 
                                    Following her lead, Wraith found the strength to break free from her prison and escape into a different reality - this reality.

                                    One day, Octavio Silva was bored. In fact, he was bored most days. 
                                    Son of the preoccupied CEO of Silva Pharmaceuticals and wanting for nothing in life, he entertained himself by performing death-defying stunts and posting holovids of them for his fans to gawk over. 
                                    He decided to set the course record for a nearby Gauntlet by launching himself across the finish line – using a grenade.

                                    Bloodhound is known across the Outlands as one of the greatest game hunters the Frontier has ever seen. The child of two engineers stationed at the New Dawn industrial plant on Talos, Bloodhound was taken in by their uncle Artur after a meltdown destroyed the facility and killed both their parents. 
                                    Artur taught them the Old Ways, a belief system that focuses on the glory of nature and rejects modern technology. 
                                    et Bloodhound was constantly drawn to technological marvels, and ultimately used both new and old methods to take down a Goliath that preyed on the people of their village, forever changing their life’s path.

                                    Alexander Nox used to be one of the brightest scientists in the employ of Humbert Labs, the Frontier’s leading manufacturer of pesticide gases.
                                    Nox worked day and night developing new formulas for the glut of pesticides needed to protect the crops that sustained the Outlands. But he soon realized that progress was being hampered by his testing methods.
                                    He needed to test on more than just inert tissue: he needed living subjects.

                                    Ajay Che, aka Lifeline, isn’t someone you would expect to find in the Apex Games. The child of wealthy war profiteers, she left home when she learned of the damage her family had caused and enlisted in the Frontier Corps, a humanitarian organization that aids Frontier communities in need.
                                     She’s since devoted her life to helping others and joined the Apex Games to give more funds to those in need.

                                        Since no one in the Games is innocent — they all know what they signed up for — and every one of her victories means help for those in need, Lifeline has no problem engaging in the popular bloodsport. 
                                        Or so she tells herself. She may seem sarcastic and callous, but deep down she wants to help people and make the world a better place. If that means taking a few people down in the process, so be it.

                                     Pathfinder is the picture of optimism, despite his circumstances. A MRVN (Mobile Robotic Versatile eNtity) with a talent for location scouting and surveying, he booted up decades ago in an abandoned warehouse with no idea who created him or why.
                                    With only his MRVN designation to hint at his identity, Pathfinder eventually set off in search of his creator. Thanks to the help of the Legends, he learned he was built by the Outlands’ greatest scientists to help solve the Outlands’ energy crisis.

                                    But time changes everything, and when his programming finally failed, he saw what he had become at the hands of the Mercenary Syndicate and Hammond Robotics: a walking nightmare of steel and vestigial flesh. 
                                    His masters resurrected him as a simulacrum, snatching him from death’s embrace again and again and programming him to forget.
